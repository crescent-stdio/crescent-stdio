- I am interested in the various traces in the world.
- I expressed our lives using various tools and languages, not limited to just one way.
  - `Web Development`: Back-end(Go, FastAPI, Next.js) & Front-end(Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS) & Deploy with Docker/Docker Compose
  - `Processing data with Python`: Pytorch, Pandas, scikit-learn, Numpy, etc.
  - `Data Art`: Using data sonification(Supercollider, Max/MSP, Sonic PI) & visualization(Processing, p5.js) to create stories.
- Recently, I am interested in 🎼`MIR(Music information retrieval)`.
  - One of my works, [`Fantastic AI Sinawi`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQMfEKEXb0s) has been accepted into [`ISMIR 2022 Music Program`](https://ismir2022program.ismir.net/music_347.html).

- I am also interested in `AI as a service`.
  - During the fall semester, I led a project to develop an AI model demo. I built the entire platform, from the web application to the inference server. I also implemented a feature to send inference results via email, which improved user convenience.
  - In addition, I created an AI webcam application for facial expression recognition and expression in the age of AI. This application was exhibited at the [2023 Art & Technology Conference 《Delicate disorder and precarious shelter》](https://www.instagram.com/atc.sogang/)
