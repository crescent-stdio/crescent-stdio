> 세상의 어둠을 행복으로 밝혀주는 달빛처럼 🌃 <br/>
> Like the moonlight brightening the world's darkness with happiness.

- I am interested in the various traces in the world.
- I expressed our lives using various tools and languages, not limited to just one way.
  - `Web Development`: Back-end(Go, FastAPI, Next.js) & Front-end(Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS) & Deploy with Docker/Docker Compose
  - `Processing data with Python`: Pytorch, Pandas, scikit-learn, Numpy, etc.
  - `Data Art`: Using data sonification(Supercollider, Max/MSP, Sonic PI) & visualization(Processing, p5.js) to create stories.
- Recently, I am interested in 🎼`MIR(Music information retrieval)`.
  - One of my works, [`Fantastic AI Sinawi`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQMfEKEXb0s) has been accepted into [`ISMIR 2022 Music Program`](https://ismir2022program.ismir.net/music_347.html).
  > 박한나, 한단비내린, 오채령 and 정다샘. (2023). [Fantastic AI Sinawi: 심층신경망 기반 국악 선율 작곡을 활용한 시나위 창작.](https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002952465) 디지털콘텐츠학회논문지, 24(4), 785-796.
- I am also interested in `using AI to provide services`.
  - During the fall semester, I led a project to develop an AI model demo. I built the entire platform, from the web application to the inference server. I also implemented a feature to send inference results via email, which improved user convenience.
  - In addition, I created an AI webcam application for facial expression recognition and expression in the age of AI. This application was exhibited at the [2023 Art & Technology Conference 《Delicate disorder and precarious shelter》](https://www.instagram.com/atc.sogang/)
  
- I like to 📷capture the memories of people's moments.
- I LOVE having 🍵tea. 
- I bake 🥐bread and turn on the 🎻viola.
